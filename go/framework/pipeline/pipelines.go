// Plugin is the parent interface for all Polaris pipeline plugins.
// In the Polaris Distributed Scheduling Framework, there are three pipelines:
//   - Scheduling pipeline
//   - Sampling pipeline
//   - Binding pipeline
//
// The Polaris scheduling pipeline runs as part of the Polaris Scheduler. It is the main pipeline of the Scheduling Framework and is
// responsible for sorting the incoming pods and for each pod obtain node samples from all clusters (using the sampling pipeline in the Cluster Agents),
// and decide on which node to schedule the pod.
// The scheduling pipeline and consists of the following stages:
//   - Sort (one plugin only)
//   - SampleNodes (one plugin only)
//   - PreFilter
//   - Filter
//   - PreScore
//   - Score
//   - Reserve
//
// The stages from PreFilter up to (including) Reserve are called the "Decision Pipeline".
// For Decision Pipeline plugins it is common to tie into multiple stages of the pipeline.
// For each pipeline instance only a single instance of each plugin will be created, even if it ties
// into multiple stages (e.g., PreFilter, Filter, and Score).
//
// Multiple Decision Pipeline instances may execute in parallel, but each instance will
// execute on a single goroutine and only be traversed by a single pod at a time.
//
// The Polaris sampling pipeline runs as part of the Polaris Cluster Agent. It is responsible for collecting a set of nodes (the sample),
// which are capable of running the pod, for which they are requested.
// The sampling pipeline consists of the following stages:
//   - SamplingStrategy (one plugin only)
//   - PreFilter
//   - Filter
//   - PreScore
//   - Score
//
// The Polaris binding pipeline runs as part of the Polaris Cluster Agent. It is responsible for detecting any conflicts that a scheduling
// decision may create on the target node (e.g., overprovisioning of resources).
// The binding pipeline consists of the following stages:
//   - CheckConflicts
//
// ToDo: Extend binding pipeline with stages that allow provisioning of a volume (this
// may require multiple stages, e.g., before creating the pod in the orchestrator and after creating the pod).
